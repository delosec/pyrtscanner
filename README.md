# pyrtcanner
Simple python port scanner and banner grabber - First Python network project - I started this to help me understand how sockets work in Python, specifically the socket.recv() object, which I've used to grab the banner (data) being sent by the connected port.

Usage 

python pyrtscan.py

plug in IP address or hostname when prompted

Kick back and relax.

TODO:

Add HTTP GET/POST socket.send for ports that don't send data

Add specific port functionality
